    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="yummy lasagna from bon appetit">
    <p>A rich, comforting slice of heaven — this lasagna layers velvety béchamel, robust tomato-basil sauce, perfectly seasoned ground meat, and tender pasta sheets, all baked until bubbling and golden, with a crown of melted mozzarella and a kiss of Parmesan crisp on top. Every bite is a warm hug of savory, creamy, and cheesy goodness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>minced garlic</li>
        <li>ground beef</li>
        <li>dried oregano</li>
        <li>dried basil</li>
        <li>crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>fresh basil</li>
        <li>lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4>In a large pan, sauté onion and garlic in olive oil until soft. Add ground beef, cook until browned. Stir in tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, herbs, salt, and pepper. Simmer until rich and thick.</li>
        <li><h4>Make the Bechemel</h4>In a saucepan, melt butter, whisk in flour to form a roux, then gradually whisk in warm milk. Stir constantly until smooth and thick. Season with salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li><h4>Cook the Noodles</h4>Boil lasagna noodles until al dente (unless using no-boil), then drain and set aside on parchment or lightly oiled sheets to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><h4>Assemble the Lasagna</h4>In a baking dish, layer meat sauce, noodles, béchamel, and shredded mozzarella. Repeat layers until ingredients are used, finishing with béchamel and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan.</li>
        <li><h4>Bake and Serve</h4>Bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 40 minutes, or until bubbly and golden on top. Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. Enjoy!</li>
